        "- A root of a function refers to the elements of the subset belonging to the range of a function that when evaluated against the function result in the output being equal to 0.\n",
        "- Say you have an equation, f(x) = 9x + 3, this is a linear equation, as in the degree of the polynomial f(x) is equal to 1. If we equate this to 0, we get 9x + 3 = 0 => 9x = -3 => x = -3/9 = -1/3.\n",
        "- As we get to higher order equations such as that of the degree two functions such as g(x) = 9x^2 + 3x + 2, we resort to \"formulas\" such as the quadratic root ( -b +- (sqrt(b^2-4ac)/2a))/2a.\n",
        "- If the equation is cubic such as h(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x + 64, we can still have a cubic equation. And someone could easily extrapolate out of this pattern by saying that for every degree x function we could have a formula. But it gets increasingly hard to formulate these root finding formulas.\n",
        "- At this point we are left to estimating the roots to these functions. This is what we will be discusing in this assignment."

For instance, if a function f(x) had its f(a) > 0 and its f(b) < 0 then by the intermediate value theorem it would have atleast one of its roots on the interval (a,b). If m, the midpoint in the interval (a,b) is equal to a, where a > 0, then one of the roots is guaranteed to be at (m, b) and the other way around if the conditions apply. It's similar to binary search in the sense that the search space halves if the midpoint is not the root of the function.\n",
